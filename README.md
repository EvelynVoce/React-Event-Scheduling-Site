# Eventathon

DevSoc events planner, calendar and attendance system / tool.

## Introduction

This is a system that is planned to be created over a weekend, and is created with the intent that it can:

- Allow us to plan and schedule events
- It has some kind of visual calendar to see when events are happening
- People can register their attendance when our events happen.

For more information on exactly what's planned, take a look at the documents in the [docs folder](./docs).
